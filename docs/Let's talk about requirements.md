*"Statements that describe what a product or system needs to do or achieve to meet the needs of stakeholders."*
## Development driven by product or customer?

The first step for every project is to collect inputs from the stakeholders of the project about what they expect from the product. This **customer-driven development** helps to align with customer goals, increasing the likelihood of adoption and satisfaction and minimises the risk of wasted development effort on unwanted or irrelevant features. 

**Product-driven development** focuses on creating a product based on the vision of the development team or organisation, rather than strictly adhering to customer-defined requirements. It emphasises innovation, creativity, and an understanding of future market trends to deliver a product.

When a new technology emerges, it could be that the use case and its market not entirely clear. The development usually shifts into the *product-driven* direction and the product is released to the market to *"find its place"*. When the product's customer base is identified, then the development shifts towards the *customer-driven* direction.

## The only constant in life is change

Despite every effort of gathering the most detailed requirements, they will change over time as the customer has more time to interact with the product or the market dynamic changes. Technological advances and regulatory changes are also big effect in requirement changes. The rule of thumb is **around 10% of the requirements are changed every month**.

## No plan survives first contact with the enemy

One way to address the risk of following a plan based on an outdated set of requirements is to gather feedback on the product and design ideas as early as possible. The development process should support the rapid creation of representative prototypes to showcase the development team's ideas and collect feedback from customers.
